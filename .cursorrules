# Playwright Test Automation - Cursor Rules

## Project Overview
This is a Playwright test automation project following the Page Object Model (POM) pattern with TypeScript. All code should be maintainable, scalable, and follow industry best practices.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Page Object Model (POM) - MANDATORY
- **ALL page interactions MUST be in Page Objects, NEVER in test files**
- Test files should ONLY contain: test logic, assertions, and test data setup
- Page Objects encapsulate all locators and interactions for a specific page
- Each page should extend `BasePage` class
- No direct page.locator() or page interactions in test files

### 2. DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Extract repeated code into reusable methods
- Use BasePage for common functionality
- Create utility functions for shared logic
- Use test fixtures for common setup/teardown
- Avoid duplicating locators or actions

### 3. Assertions ONLY in Test Files
- Page Objects should NEVER contain `expect()` statements
- Page Objects provide locators and actions
- Tests perform assertions using exposed public locators
- Exception: Page Objects can use `waitFor()` for synchronization

---

## Page Object Structure

### Locator Definition
- **Define ALL locators in the constructor**
- Use **private** locators for internal page interactions
- Use **public** locators for test assertions
- Never define locators outside the constructor

### Locator Priority (Most to Least Reliable)
1. `data-qa` or `data-testid` attributes
2. Role + name: `page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' })`
3. Label text: `page.getByLabel('Email')`
4. Placeholder: `page.getByPlaceholder('Enter email')`
5. Text content: `page.locator('text=Login')`
6. CSS selectors (last resort)
7. **Never use XPath** unless absolutely necessary

### Locator Best Practices
- Use data-qa attributes when available (most reliable)
- Prefer user-visible text for buttons/links
- Avoid CSS selectors tied to styling (e.g., `.btn-primary`)
- Never chain locators unnecessarily

### Page Object Methods
- Each page must have a `navigateToPage()` method
- Create action methods with clear, descriptive names
- Create helper methods for waiting (e.g., `waitForSuccess()`)
- Methods should do ONE thing and do it well
- All methods must be async when interacting with page
- **Wrap key actions in `test.step()`** for better reporting and traceability
- **Use objects for methods with 6+ parameters** - Pass an interface/type instead of individual parameters

---

## BasePage Requirements

### Universal BasePage Must Include (Basic Methods Only):

**Navigation**
- `navigateTo(url: string)` - Navigate to any URL

**Waiting Methods**
- `waitForPageLoad()` - Wait for page to load
- `waitForElement(selector: string)` - Wait for element to be visible
- `isElementVisible(selector: string): Promise<boolean>` - Check element visibility

**Utilities**
- `scrollToElement(locator: Locator)` - Scroll element into view

**Note:** Keep BasePage minimal with only truly universal methods. Application-specific methods (like logout, authentication checks, etc.) should be implemented in individual page objects where needed.

---

## Test Fixtures

### Fixture Usage (MANDATORY)
- **NEVER import Page Objects directly in test files**
- **ALWAYS use fixtures** defined in `fixtures/page-fixtures.ts`
- Test files should import `test` and `expect` from page-fixtures, not from @playwright/test
- Fixtures provide dependency injection and ensure clean test setup

---

## Test Steps (`test.step`)

### test.step Usage Rules
- **Use test.step in Page Objects ONLY** - Never in test files
- Wrap key page actions in `test.step()` for better reporting
- Test files should call page methods directly without additional test.step wrappers
- This provides clean, readable test reports with action-level granularity

---

## Test Structure

### Test Organization
- Use `test.describe()` to group related tests
- Use `test.beforeEach()` for setup that runs before each test
- Use `test.beforeAll()` for expensive setup (e.g., creating existing users)
- Use nested `test.describe()` blocks for sub-groups with specific preconditions

### Test Best Practices
- **Use AAA Pattern** - Arrange, Act, Assert
- **One assertion per test** (or closely related assertions)
- **Each test MUST end with assertion** - No tests without verification
- **Descriptive test names** - `should [expected behavior] when [condition]`
- **Independent tests** - Each test should be able to run alone
- **Clean test data** - Use unique data for each test run
- **No conditional logic in tests** - Tests should have a linear flow (no if/else statements)
- **Use fixtures, not direct imports** - NEVER import Page Objects directly in tests
- **Use test.step in Page Objects ONLY** - Never use test.step in test files
- Tests should be able to run in parallel

### Test Naming Convention
- Test files: `camelCase.spec.ts` (e.g., `login.spec.ts`, `signup.spec.ts`)
- Test descriptions: Start with "should" and describe expected behavior

---

## Test Data Management

### Test Data Structure
- Create `TEST_EMAILS` object with predefined test scenarios
- Use getters for dynamic values (e.g., `get valid()` to generate unique emails)
- Create `USER` object for predefined user data
- Include timestamps in emails for uniqueness: `faker.string.alphanumeric(5) + Date.now() + '@testmail.com'`

### Test Data Functions
- Create `generateUserData()` function that accepts partial overrides
- Use `Partial<UserData>` for optional overrides
- Support overriding specific fields while keeping defaults for others
- Always use Faker for random data generation

### Test Data Best Practices
- Define constants for fixed test data
- Use getters for dynamic values
- Type all data with interfaces
- **ALWAYS export and reuse interfaces** - NEVER define the same interface in multiple files
- Import interfaces from `testData.ts` or other utility files
- Use objects for methods accepting 6+ parameters

---

## Naming Conventions

### Files
- Page Objects: `PascalCase.ts` (e.g., `LoginPage.ts`, `SignUpPage.ts`)
- Tests: `camelCase.spec.ts` (e.g., `login.spec.ts`, `signup.spec.ts`)
- Utils: `camelCase.ts` (e.g., `testData.ts`, `helpers.ts`)

### Classes & Methods
- Classes: `PascalCase` (e.g., `class LoginPage`)
- Methods: `camelCase` (e.g., `async navigateToLogin()`)
- Private locators: `camelCase` with `private readonly`
- Public locators: `camelCase` with `public readonly`

### Variables
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `TEST_EMAILS`, `USER`)
- Variables: `camelCase` (e.g., `const userData = ...`)
- Interfaces: `PascalCase` (e.g., `interface UserData`)

---

## TypeScript Requirements

- **Always use TypeScript** - No plain JavaScript
- **Type everything** - No `any` types
- **Use interfaces** for complex data structures
- **Use Partial<T>** for optional overrides
- **Export types** from testData for reuse
- **Async/await** for all Playwright operations
- **Use const** by default, `let` only when reassignment needed
- Properly type all function parameters and return values

---

## Error Handling & Debugging

### Waits
- Use explicit waits with conditions: `element.waitFor({ state: 'visible' })`
- Use page load waits: `page.waitForLoadState('networkidle')`
- **Avoid hard-coded delays** - Never use `page.waitForTimeout()` unless absolutely necessary

### Screenshots & Traces
- Screenshots and videos should be configured in `playwright.config.ts`
- Automatically capture on failure
- Manual screenshots use `BasePage.takeScreenshot()` method
- Enable trace on retry for debugging

### Timeouts
- Set reasonable timeouts in config
- Override timeouts for specific slow operations with `test.setTimeout()`
- Document why custom timeouts are needed

---

## Configuration Best Practices

### playwright.config.ts Requirements
- Set `baseURL` for the application under test
- Configure `fullyParallel: true`
- Set `retries` for CI environment
- Configure `trace: 'on-first-retry'`
- Configure `screenshot: 'only-on-failure'`
- Configure `video: 'retain-on-failure'`
- Include multiple browser projects (chromium, firefox, webkit)

---

## Playwright MCP Integration

When generating tests using Playwright MCP:
- **Always follow POM** - Generate both page object and test file
- **Use existing patterns** - Match the style of existing code
- **Include proper imports** - Page objects, test data, etc.
- **Add JSDoc comments** - Document methods and parameters
- **Generate typed test data** - Use interfaces
- **Create reusable methods** - Not one-off code
- **Follow project structure** - Place files in correct directories
- Ensure generated code follows all rules in this file

## Anti-Patterns to AVOID

### Never Do This:
- ❌ Direct page interactions in test files (use Page Objects)
- ❌ Importing Page Objects directly in tests (use fixtures)
- ❌ Assertions (`expect()`) in Page Objects
- ❌ Using `test.step()` in test files (use in Page Objects only)
- ❌ Conditional logic in tests (if/else, switch statements)
- ❌ Tests without assertions at the end
- ❌ Defining interfaces multiple times (reuse from testData.ts)
- ❌ Methods with 6+ individual parameters (use objects instead)
- ❌ Hard-coded test data (use generators with timestamps)
- ❌ Code duplication (extract to reusable methods)
- ❌ Defining locators outside constructor
- ❌ Using `any` type
- ❌ Hard-coded waits with `waitForTimeout()`
- ❌ Chaining locators unnecessarily
- ❌ Using XPath selectors
- ❌ CSS selectors based on styling classes
- ❌ Tests that depend on each other
- ❌ Mixing test logic with page logic

---

## Performance Best Practices

- Tests should be independent and run in parallel
- Reuse browser context with `beforeAll` for expensive setup
- Minimize navigation - navigate only when necessary
- Use API for test data setup when available (faster than UI)
- Smart waits - wait for specific conditions, not arbitrary timeouts
- Limit screenshots to failures or critical steps only

---

## Documentation Requirements

### JSDoc Comments Required For:
- Complex methods or business logic
- Public API methods in Page Objects
- Non-obvious workarounds or hacks
- Methods with multiple parameters

### JSDoc Format:
- Include description of what the method does
- Document all parameters with `@param`
- Document return type if not obvious with `@returns`
